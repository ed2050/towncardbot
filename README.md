- **/whoneeds cardname** : show who needs a card.  cardname is same as /whohas

- **/trades username** : suggest trades between you and username, based on which cards each of you need / have extra.

- **/whois username** : having trouble finding someone?  know their discord name but not town name, or vice versa?  whois shows all info about a user in the Shark Card Collection spreadsheet.  Town name, town code, discord names, nicknames, coop, etc.

- **/show username** : quick stats on user's card collection.  how many they have, how many golds, and their top (rarest) extras and missing cards.
